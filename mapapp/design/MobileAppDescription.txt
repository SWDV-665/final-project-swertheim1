The mobile App I am going to create is a basic math flash card mobile app. 

I will start with basic add, subtract, multiply, divide, then move onto more difficult math topics.

This initial app is targeting elemetary school children.

I have a apple phone that I can test the app on.
Some of the native Capacitor plugins I am considering are: 
 -- Hapatics
 -- Toast 
 -- Screen Reader
 
 
 The app will have at a minimum four graphical buttons (+, -, x, /) that will open to flash cards related to the button.
 The student will have to enter the correct response for each problem. When they have completed the set, a an encourging toast will popup with their results.
 The application should keep track of the total number of problems practiced and the total number correct.
 
 Future enhancments - is to have achivement levels. When those are reached, the problems get tougher.
